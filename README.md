## 🗣️ Specialist Advice: Communication is Key

While acronyms like `lmk` (let me know) and `brb` (be right back) are common and harmless, understanding the full spectrum of these terms allows you to monitor your children's text activity and **talk about it together**.

It can be difficult to decipher intent on a screen, so regular check-ins and open conversations are always more valuable than just monitoring. Spending time with your kids **irl** (in real life) is always the most fun.
